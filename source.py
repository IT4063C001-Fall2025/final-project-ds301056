# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->

# Many people regularly consume fast food, but nutritional information is often difficult to interpret, inconsistent across sources, or overlooked when making food choices. This creates challenges for:
# 
# Consumers ‚Üí making informed dietary decisions.
# 
# Healthcare professionals ‚Üí guiding patients on nutrition.
# 
# Researchers/educators ‚Üí understanding how fast food compares with general food supply.

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->

# What is the nutritional difference between fast food menu items and general food items, and how do these values compare against authoritative USDA standards?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->

# the answer could look like a summary table, a bar chart showing averages, boxplots with sugar per content or a scatter plot of protein vs calories.  

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->

# Kaggle Dataset (CSV) ‚Äî Fast Food Nutrition Dataset
# 
# https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/fastfood-nutrition
# 
# Contains nutrition facts for menu items from popular fast food restaurants (calories, fat, protein, etc.)
# 
# Kaggle Dataset (CSV) ‚Äî Nutritional Content of Food
# 
# https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/the-nutritional-content-of-food-a-comprehensive
# 
# Comprehensive dataset of nutrition facts for thousands of foods from various categories, not limited to fast food.
# 
# USDA FoodData Central API ‚Äî FoodData Central
# 
# https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*

# In[ ]:


# 1. Import and cleaning data
# Load the Kaggle Fast Food Nutrition dataset and General Nutrition dataset into pandas dataframes.

import pandas as pd

fast_food_df = pd.read_csv("datasets/fast_food_nutrition.csv")
general_nutrition_df = pd.read_csv("datasets/general_nutrition.csv")

# 2. Data Cleaning
# Standardize column names and units (e.g., calories, grams of fat, sugar, protein).
# Handle missing values and normalize food names for easier comparison.

# 3. USDA API Integration
# Use the USDA FoodData Central API to fetch official nutrition facts
# for selected overlapping items (e.g., "cheeseburger", "chicken sandwich", "salad").
# Align these values with Kaggle datasets to check consistency and accuracy.

# 4. Data Merging
# Create a combined dataset where each food item has:
# - Source (Fast Food, General Food, USDA)
# - Calories, fat, sugar, protein, sodium
# Use food names as keys for merging (after text cleaning/matching).

# 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# - Summary statistics (mean, median, std deviation) for each nutrient by category
# - Comparisons: Fast food vs general food vs USDA benchmarks
# - Visualization: bar charts, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps

# 6. Answering the Question
# Quantitatively: Compare calories/fat/sugar across datasets
# Qualitatively: Show how USDA data validates or contradicts Kaggle datasets
